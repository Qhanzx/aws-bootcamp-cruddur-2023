Implement a healthcheck in the V3 Docker compose file
Tried this code for healthcheck in the Docker compose file:

      interval: 60s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 20s
      timeout: 10s
      
Research best practices of Dockerfiles and attempt to implement it in your Dockerfile: 
Some of the best practices found and implemented:
Create ephemeral containers
Pipe Dockerfile through stdin
Use multi-stage builds
Use multi-stage builds

Learn how to install Docker on your localmachine and get the same containers running outside of Gitpod / Codespaces
used 'docker build -t getting-started .' to build container 
Ran it with 'docker run -d -p 80:80 docker/getting-started'

Launch an EC2 instance that has docker installed, and pull a container to demonstrate you can run your own docker processes. 
Launched an EC2 instance and updated the installed package with
sudo yum update -y

Installed most recent Docker engine with
sudo amazon-linux-extras-install docker

Started docker service
sudo service docker start

add user to docker group with
sudo usermod -a -G docker user

verify user is added 
docker info

Created a Dockerfile and built a Docker image with
docker build -t hello-world .
docker run -tip 80:80 hello-world
